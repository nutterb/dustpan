## R CMD check results
This update to `pixiedust` was requested by CRAN to update the package
overview help file that is generated by roxygen. Links to test coverage and 
Travis-CI have been removed from the README, as I am no longer able to 
keep up with those systems.

There were no warnings, errors, or notes returned by CHECK on any of the 
test environments.


## Downstream dependencies
Reverse dependency checks showed the following:

`goldfish` shows no warnings, errors, or notes.

Thanks,
Benjamin
