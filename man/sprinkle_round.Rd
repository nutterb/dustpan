\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{dust}}

\item{rows}{Either a numeric vector of rows in the tabular object to be
modified or an object of class \code{call}.  When a \code{call},
generated by \code{quote(expression)}, the expression resolves to
a logical vector the same length as the number of rows in the table.
Sprinkles are applied to where the expression resolves to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{cols}{Either a numeric vector of columns in the tabular object to
be modified, or a character vector of column names. A mixture of
character and numeric indices is permissible.}

\item{round}{\code{numeric(1)} A value to pass to the \code{digits}
argument of \code{\link{round}}.}

\item{part}{A character string denoting which part of the table to modify.}

\item{fixed}{\code{logical(1)} indicating if the values in \code{rows}
and \code{cols} should be read as fixed coordinate pairs.  By default,
sprinkles are applied at the intersection of \code{rows} and \code{cols},
meaning that the arguments do not have to share the same length.
When \code{fixed = TRUE}, they must share the same length.}

\item{recycle}{A \code{character} one that determines how sprinkles are
managed when the sprinkle input doesn't match the length of the region
to be sprinkled.  By default, recycling is turned off.  Recycling
may be performed across rows first (left to right, top to bottom),
or down columns first (top to bottom, left to right).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass to other methods. Currently ignored.}
}
\description{
The appearance of \code{NA} values in a table may be dependent
  on the context.  \code{pixiedust} uses the \code{round} sprinkle
  to guide the appearance of missing values in the table.
}
\section{Functional Requirements}{

\enumerate{
 \item Correctly reassigns the appropriate elements \code{round} column
   in the table part.
 \item Casts an error if \code{x} is not a \code{dust} object.
 \item Casts an error if \code{round} is not a \code{numeric(1)}
 \item Casts an error if \code{part} is not one of \code{"body"},
   \code{"head"}, \code{"foot"}, or \code{"interfoot"}
 \item Casts an error if \code{fixed} is not a \code{logical(1)}
 \item Casts an error if \code{recycle} is not one of \code{"none"},
   \code{"rows"}, or \code{"cols"}
 \item Cast an error if \code{recycle = "none"} and \code{round}
   does not have length 1.
}

The functional behavior of the \code{fixed} and \code{recycle} arguments
is not tested for this function. It is tested and validated in the
tests for \code{\link{index_to_sprinkle}}.
