\item{rows}{The rows over which the borders are to be drawn.}

\item{cols}{The cols over which the borders are to be drawn.}

\item{horizontal}{Logical.  Toggles horizontal borders.}

\item{vertical}{Logical. Toggles vertical borders}

\description{
For most output, specifying a region of cells with borders
  on all sides is as simple as giving the sprinkle \code{border = "all"}.
  In LaTeX output, however, this can result in thicker than expected
  vertical borders.  This medley provides a LaTeX save approach to
  drawing borders on all sides without getting the double vertical
  border effect.
