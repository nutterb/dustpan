\title{Access and manipulate table numbers counters}
\source{
The concept for these functions is loosely based on a hook meant to work with
\code{knitr} to automatically number tables.

\usage{
get_pixie_count()

set_pixie_count(value)

increment_pixie_count(increment = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{value}{The value at which to set the pixie counter.}

\item{increment}{The value to add to the current pixie count.  Defaults to 1.}
}
\description{
While LaTeX provides the ability to automatically number tables, this
functionality is not readily available with console, HTML, or Word output.  By
keep track of the number of (captioned) tables, we can mimic the behavior of
LaTeX tables to provide (mostly) consistent table numbering between formats.  The
table numbering is stored in the \code{pixie_count} option.
}
\details{
The pixie count is stored in the options and may also be accessed using
\code{getOption("pixie_count")}.

\code{get_pixie_count} returns the current value of the counter.

\code{set_pixie_count} sets the value to the user-specification.

\code{increment_pixie_count} increments the pixie count, usually by 1.  This is called
  within \code{print.dust} any time a \code{dust} object has a caption.
