\usage{
tidy_levels_labels(
  object,
  descriptors = "term",
  numeric_level = c("term", "term_plain", "label"),
  argcheck = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A model object, ideally with a \code{model.frame} method.
It is unclear at the moment (18 Sept. 2015) what will happen if
an object is passed that does not have a \code{model.frame} method.}

\item{descriptors}{A character vector indicating the descriptors to
be used in the table.  Acceptable inputs are \code{"term"},
\code{"term_plain"}, \code{"label"}, \code{"level"}, and
\code{"level_detail"}.  These may be used in any combination and
any order, with the descriptors appearing in the table from left
to right in the order given.  The default, \code{"term"}, returns
only the term descriptor and is identical to the output provided
by \code{broom::tidy} methods.  See Details for a full explanation
of each option and the Examples for sample output.}

\item{numeric_level}{A character string that determines which descriptor
is used for numeric variables in the \code{"level_detail"} descriptor
when a numeric has an interaction with a factor.  Acceptable inputs
are \code{"term"}, \code{"term_plain"}, and \code{"label"}.}

\item{argcheck}{An assert collection created by \code{checkmate::makeAssertCollection}.
Under normal circumstances, this is passed from \code{dust}.  If \code{NULL},
as in the case it is run outside of \code{dust}, a new collection is
created and the assertions are reported within \code{tidy_levels_labels}.}
}
\description{
Default model objects identify rows of results with
  appropriate term name.  More often than not, the term name is
  not suitable for formally reported output.  \code{tidy_levels_labels}
  performs some basic work to quickly provide more readable
  descriptors for cases where they can easily be obtained.  These
  descriptors are retrieved from the data, however, so the
  utility is determined by the user's habits in providing
  term labels and meaningful factor levels.

  Due to the complexity of the terms that could be used for a model,
  it isn't practical to attempt to recover human-ready descriptors
  for every conceivable term.  This would require recovering variable
  names for any number of functions.  \code{pixiedust} only
  goes after the easiest to obtain. Replacements no managed by
  \code{tidy_levels_labels} may still be made with the \code{replace}
  sprinkle.
}
\details{
The user may select up to five columns of descriptors,
  although doing so would certainly create some ambiguity.  See
  the Examples for sample output.
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{"term"} }{The term name used in the R model summary}
    \item{\code{"term_plain"} }{The term name used in the formula.
      For variables that produce multiple term names (such as factors),
      the plain term name may be duplicated.  For example, a factor that
      has term names \code{FctrB} and \code{FctrC}, indicating rows for
      levels \code{B} and \code{C} of the variable \code{Fctr}, will
      have two rows of \code{"term_plain"} of just \code{Fctr}.}
    \item{\code{"label"} }{Provides the label attached to the data using
      \code{labelVector::get_label}.  When a term is not associated with a label,
      the value of \code{term_plain} is returned instead. Note that, variable names
      will disassociate with a label if they are used in a function (such
      as \code{factor(x)} or \code{x^2}.}
    \item{\code{"level"} }{Indicates the level being compared within a factor
      (or an interaction involving a factor), otherwise it returns \code{NA}.
      It may also be said that this value is the appendix to a factor name.
      For the term \code{FctrB}, this would just be \code{B}.}
    \item{\code{"level_detail"} }{Gives additional information to \code{level}
      by including the reference level of the factor.  For the term \code{FctrB},
      this would return \code{"B vs A"}.  When an interaction with a numeric
      variable is present, the \code{level} for the numeric may be either
      \code{term_plain} or \code{label}, the choice being controlled by the
      \code{level_detail} argument.}
  }
}
\section{Restrictions}{

The descriptors, other than \code{"term"}, generally don't make sense for data
frame objects.  The use of \code{tidy_levels_labels} is not permitted within
the \code{dust} function, but is allowed if you really want it by
\code{pixiedust:::tidy_levels_labels}.

Other special cases noted in future uses will be documented here, but in
general, if it isn't a model object, you probably don't really want to
use this.
