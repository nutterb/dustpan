#### 0.1.1-2 (4 August 2015)
* Optimizations to the code base.  Namely, removing a lot of ifelse
  statements.  This appears to have cut the processing time in half.
* Instead of storing most of the values in the dust object as 
  NA, they are now stored as "", which makes it easier to do the 
  character string manipulations and speeds up the reassignments (at
  the cost of increased object size).

#### 0.1.1 (3 August 2015)
* Added the necessary fields to DESCRIPTION to get the vignettes to build.

#### 0.1.0 (1 August 2015)
* CRAN checks are passed.  Prepared for release.

#### 0.0.0-9 (31 July 2015)
* Finished tests
* Finished vignettes

#### 0.0.0-8 (30 July 2015)
* Finished HTML rendering
* Adds pixiedust vignette
* Removes old vignettes

#### 0.0.0-7 (29 July 2015)
* Replace nearly all dust bunny functions with `sprinkle`
* Replace `dust_print_method` with `sprinkle_print_method`
* Replace `dust_colnames` with `sprinkle_colnames`
* It occurred to me as I studied the code base that instead
  of rows and cols in the ... argument of the dust bunnies, 
  it made more sense to add the dust bunnies in ... with
  formal arguments for row and col.  I also came up 
  with the idea of naming the package `pixiedust` and 
  sprinkling the dust around.  It sounded like fun so 
  let's hope CRAN lets me get away with it.
* All functionality has been rewritten to support the
  pixiedust paradigm, but new tests and vignettes need 
  to be written to confirm that it all works.
* R CMD check has _NOT_ been run.

#### 0.0.0-6 (28 July 2015)
* Adds `dust_rotate_text`

#### 0.0.0-5 (27 July 2015)
* Adds `dust_cell_valign`
* Adds `dust_border_collapse`
* Adds `dust_table_border`
* Adds `dust_cell_border`
* Adds `dust_cell_padding`

#### 0.0.0-4 (26 July 2015)
* Improved the Dustbunnies vignette to use a color coded table indicating which 
  dust bunnies are planned, available, and functional for different printing 
  methods.
* Dropped leading zeroes from the version number.
* Adds `dust_font_color`, `dust_font_size`
* Adds `dust_cell_height`, `dust_cell_width`

#### 0.0.0-003 (25 July 2015)
* Adds halign and valign attributes to `dust$obj`. valign is not yet implemented.
* Adds `dust_cell_halign`
* Adds `dust_head_halign`
* Adds dustbunnies vignette
* Removed the `col_names` attribute of the `dust` object and replaced it with the
  `head` object.  The `head` object is a data frame holding the attributes of the
  table header.
* Renamed the `obj` attributes of the `dust` object to `body`.
* Adds a lot of tests
* Adds `dust_cell_bg` and `dust_bg_pattern`

#### 0.0.0-002 (24 July 2015)
* 'col_names` attribute is now named.  The names are the original 
  column names from the `broom` output.
* Adds `dust_fn`
* Adds `dust_bold`
* Adds `dust_italic`
* Adds `dust_print_format`
* Imports knitr
* Imports `lazyWeave::pvalString`


#### 0.0.0-001 (23 July 2015)
* Adds `dust` and `print.dust`.
* Only the method for printing to the console is available.
* `+.dust` added
