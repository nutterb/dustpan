#' @title Prepare Glance Statistics for \code{pixiedust} Table Footer
#' @description Retrieves the \code{broom::glance} output for a model object and 
#'   structures it into a table suitable to be placed in the footer.  By default,
#'   the statistics are displayed in two column-pairings (see Details).  This 
#'   function is not exported but is documented to maintain clarity of its 
#'   behavior.  It is intended for use within \code{dust}, but may be useful
#'   elsewhere if used with caution.
#'   
#' @param fit A model object with a \code{broom::glance} method.
#' @param col_pairs An integer indicating the number of column-pairings for the 
#'   glance output.  This must be less than half the total number of columns,
#'   as each column-pairing includes a statistic name and value.
#' @param total_cols The total number of columns in the body of the pixiedust table
#' @param glance_stats A character vector giving the names of the glance statistics
#'   to put in the output.  When \code{NULL}, the default, all of the available 
#'   statistics are retrieved.  In addition to controlling which statistics are 
#'   printed, this also controls the order in which they are printed.
#' @param byrow A logical, defaulting to \code{FALSE}, that indicates if the 
#'   requested statistics are placed with priority to rows or columns.  See Details.
#'   
#' @details Statistics are placed in column-pairings.  Each column pair consists of 
#'   two columns named \code{stat_name_x} and \code{stat_value_x}, where \code{x} is 
#'   the integer index of the column pair.  The column-pairings are used to allow 
#'   the user to further customize the output, more-so than pasting the name and 
#'   value together would allow.  With this design, statistics can be rounded 
#'   differently by applying sprinkles to the resulting table.
#'   
#'   The total number of column-pairings must be less than or equal to half the 
#'   number of total columns.  This constraint prevents making glance tables that 
#'   have more columns than the model table it accompanies.  
#'   
#'   When the total number of column-parings is strictly less than half the total 
#'   number of columns, "filler" columns are placed between the column pairings.
#'   As much as possible, the filler columns are placed evenly between the 
#'   column pairings, but when the number of filler columns is unequal between 
#'   column-pairings, there will be more space placed on the left side.  For example,
#'   if a table has 7 columns and 3 column-pairings, the order of placement would be
#'   column-pair-1, filler, column-pair-2, column-pair-3.  Since there was only room
#'   for one column of filler, it was placed in the left most fill position.
#'   
#'   The \code{byrow} arguments acts similarly to the \code{byrow} argument in the
#'   \code{matrix} function, but defaults to \code{FALSE}.  If four statistics are 
#'   requested and \code{byrow = FALSE}, the left column-pair will have statistics 
#'   one and two, while the right column-pair will have statistics three and four.
#'   If \code{byrow = TRUE}, however, the left column-pair will have statistics
#'   one and three, while the right column-pair will have statistics two and four.
